      "<p>We want to bring aquaponics into every home. In order to reach this goal, we needed to create a system that is very simple, complete,  and much more compact and affordable than existing complete systems. Most aquaponics kits available today focus on either the fish or the garden. Most don't include lights, and if they do, these lights tend to be woefully inadequate or if adequate offered in very expensive, expansive systems. As electrical engineers and physicists, understanding lighting is one of our strengths. As consumers we understand that most homes do not have space for a large aquaponic system.  The Aquakit is designed to be a complete system that is compact and very easy to set up. You do not have to figure out what kind of light to purchase as we have designed a complete LED lighting system that is energy efficient and targets the exact wavelengths that are utilized by terrestrial plants.

      " As our society begins to wake up from the hangover of unconscionable waste, we need to turn to the model of nature and learn how to conserve and reuse our resources. Instead of throwing chemicals into a sterile system, aquaponics creates a harmonious cycle that saves water, energy and waste that can serve as a centerpiece to your room as a living reminder to the responsibility we have to future generations while at the same time providing food and keeping your pets healthy,happy and beautiful.   \n",
      "Our website: www.hnuqiponics.com\n",
      "Have you ever wanted to keep fish but the constant maintenance and cleaning scares you off? Do you enjoy fresh herbs when you cook but haven't been able to successfully keep a fresh herb garden? Do you live in a climate where the growing season is very short? Have you ever wanted to keep some exotic flowering plants but found the care to be overwhelming? What if there was a system that would allow you to raise fish and plants with little maintenance and without an advanced degree in biology? The Aquakit creates a balanced environment that allows both plants and animals to flourish while taking away all of the work of daily maintenance.\n",
      "We are not the first company to offer an aquaponics system for home use. We applaud all efforts in this field and support all participants who understand that aquaponics is very much the future of our food production. We cannot sustain the current model of wasting water and over nutrifying our waterways. \n",
      "We want to bring aquaponics into every home. In order to reach this goal, we needed to create a system that is very simple, complete,  and much more compact and affordable than existing complete systems. Most aquaponics kits available today focus on either the fish or the garden. Most don't include lights, and if they do, these lights tend to be woefully inadequate or if adequate offered in very expensive, expansive systems. As electrical engineers and physicists, understanding lighting is one of our strengths. As consumers we understand that most homes do not have space for a large aquaponic system.  The Aquakit is designed to be a complete system that is compact and very easy to set up. You do not have to figure out what kind of light to purchase as we have designed a complete LED lighting system that is energy efficient and targets the exact wavelengths that are utilized by terrestrial plants. And you do not have to sacrifice a large amount of living space to accommodate an expensive Cadillac, aquaponic system. \n",
      "We chose not to include a 10 gallon tank because these are readily available and typically cost between $10-$15 at your local pet store. All of the other major components are included with every Aquakit. The only choosing you need to do is what you want to grow and keep. The Aquakit makes it easy for you to construct a 10 gallon system that will quickly become the centerpiece of your home. We look forward to seeing what you create!\n"

After all:We wanted to design and develop something that can help any one (technical or non-technical) explore their vision of creating something cool while on the play! And this was made even better by introducing the popular micro-controller BBC micro:bit board.For those new to the micro:bit community, here is a short summary of \"What micro:bit is all about\" and what this tiny board is capable of. This time, we wanted to explore our ideas for the micro:bit (unlike our other campaigns). The micro:bit was the most recent project by the BBC in an effort to bring computer science education and STEM topics to every student worldwide. It is now so popular that every maker community has it and there are numerous projects and campaigns designed and developed for the micro:bit exclusively.So this video here, by the BBC micro:bit tells us about its popularity. You can code, customize, and control the micro:bit from anywhere! Listed below are few of its in-built features.The micro:bit can be used for all sorts of unique creations, from robots to musical instruments and more. And this time, it could be more fun because we have integrated the \"fun and learn\" concept.We present to you the Stem:Bit! An easy to assemble and play with blocks kit for micro:bit. Yes, you heard it right, a programmable blocks kit.As the name suggests, it is compiled using 2 different yet the widely used terms, \"Stem\" from the STEM Education society and \"Bit\" from the micro:bit community. It basically focuses on indulging every kid and/or the techie to play and have fun along with learning to program. It gives a boost at learning the programming with micro:bit and playing along.In other simple words, with Stem:Bit kids can utilize micro:bit to fully realize their ideas and truly unlock their imagination while on the play.The kit is actually a programmable blocks kit that has more than 260 building blocks! Its core is the micro:bit and the micro:bit Stem Board.The Stem board is a specially designed expansion board that is used for programming different movements, structures, sensors etc using the micro:bit.Stem:Bit is an easy to assemble and design codes about learning how to program the moves of different structures using the micro:bit. Using Stem:Bit you will learn programming, electronics, robotics and many more.The easy assembling of the blocks to form many structures. and it is made even more easy with the help of an assembly manual that comes with the kit.We have designed this project manual book (approximately 200-300 pages) especially for the children so that they can learn to make different applications using Stem:Bit giving them the scope to improvise and enhance their vision of programming and learning.2 High-Power RGB colorful searchlights3 SMD RGB programming lightsDrive three 5V servos, easy to play with robots Drive two 3V DC motors, easily experiment with small fans/smart cars Buzzer can be programmed to play various songs and music Powered by 500mAh high-capacity lithium battery Charging via a USB cable Multiple protection circuits: over-discharge protection, over-charge protection, and reverse-connection protectionExpansion board integrates an infrared ranging pair tube, a high-precision tracking probe, and an ultrasonic module interfaceTransform the entire expansion board into a smart car chassis for a micro:bit smart car Three kinds of communication interfaces: IIC, SPI, serial  communication, easy to expand PS2 controller, Bluetooth module and other external devices. Gentle warning..!

And this was made even better by introducing the popular micro-controller BBC micro:bit board.For those new to the micro:bit community, here is a short summary of \"What micro:bit is all about\" and what this tiny board is capable of. This time, we wanted to explore our ideas for the micro:bit (unlike our other campaigns). The micro:bit was the most recent project by the BBC in an effort to bring computer science education and STEM topics to every student worldwide. It is now so popular that every maker community has it and there are numerous projects and campaigns designed and developed for the micro:bit exclusively.So this video here, by the BBC micro:bit tells us about its popularity. You can code, customize, and control the micro:bit from anywhere! Listed below are few of its in-built features.The micro:bit can be used for all sorts of unique creations, from robots to musical instruments and more. And this time, it could be more fun because we have integrated the \"fun and learn\" concept.We present to you the Stem:Bit! An easy to assemble and play with blocks kit for micro:bit. Yes, you heard it right, a programmable blocks kit.As the name suggests, it is compiled using 2 different yet the widely used terms, \"Stem\" from the STEM Education society and \"Bit\" from the micro:bit community. It basically focuses on indulging every kid and/or the techie to play and have fun along with learning to program. It gives a boost at learning the programming with micro:bit and playing along.In other simple words, with Stem:Bit kids can utilize micro:bit to fully realize their ideas and truly unlock their imagination while on the play.The kit is actually a programmable blocks kit that has more than 260 building blocks! Its core is the micro:bit and the micro:bit Stem Board.The Stem board is a specially designed expansion board that is used for programming different movements, structures, sensors etc using the micro:bit.Stem:Bit is an easy to assemble and design codes about learning how to program the moves of different structures using the micro:bit. Using Stem:Bit you will learn programming, electronics, robotics and many more.The easy assembling of the blocks to form many structures. and it is made even more easy with the help of an assembly manual that comes with the kit.We have designed this project manual book (approximately 200-300 pages) especially for the children so that they can learn to make different applications using Stem:Bit giving them the scope to improvise and enhance their vision of programming and learning.Gentle warning..! You may end up having endless fun!After all, there is a lot to do when you have a huge collection of the block to compile together.To quote a few names, find the examples below about a few structures that you can build with the Stem:Bit.This will help you to learn Infra-Red sensors and it let you program the very famous             Line-Following Robot. You can also make complex lines and program the IR car to solve line puzzles. Play and program with the 4x4 concept of the 4x4 car. Love the tall building equipment? Learn how they work with this structure   Learn how a spider walks using the 6 legs. Enjoy it more when you control it with a joystick. Love the funky tuk tuk rides? Well then, ride one. ;) Learn the robotics basics using the love of the robots.  Relive the famous slingshot game using the technology. Tanks and military bots at your service. Nurture your desire to drive the heavy machines with these blocks programmed by you. Play the clipping machine game with the clipper robot. The biggest difference with this kit is that we have combined the electronic components with building blocks, and users can control them with micro:bit programming, such as infrared remote control, obstacle  avoidance, tracking, colorful lights and other functions. The building blocks are also compatible with LEGO, that if you are interested in building blocks and want to learn programming, this building block will be a good choice.  Additionally, you will learn the simple yet practical IoT theory, interfacing of different sensors, make robotic movements with the structures enhancing the robotics concepts.Learn controlling the robots using the wireless game pad.Stem:Bit building blocks kit provides multiple basic models. With a  wealth of circuit components, it can achieve many creative plays, such  as remote control tracked vehicles, magic lights robots, robotic arm towers and so on.  Building blocks and electronic modules are used to form a smart robot car, which can be programmed to avoid obstacles and track automatically.   With more than 260 building blocks, it  can form more shapes and be controlled by programming circuits.Stem:Bit programming building block kit can be expanded to other models with LEGO™ building block. Children can complete their own  work with a rich imagination.Since it is based on the BBC micro:bit, thus it supports a variety of programming methods, supporting the online graphical programming of Make Code Editor and Python programming. You can realize your program creativity on computer or mobile app.Since it is based on the BBC micro:bit, thus it supports a variety of programming methods, supporting the online graphical programming of MakeCode Editor and Python programming.Thank you for reading out our campaign. :)As a token of thanks, we\\'d like to stretch our rewards for the backers.
